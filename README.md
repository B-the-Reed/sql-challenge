# sql-challenge

This repository contains my SQL Challenge submission for Module 9 of the UCB Data Analytics Boot Camp. 

## Notes

The Employees folder contains the following files: 
- sql_challenge_ERD.png: This file shows the ERD diagram for all tables. 
- table_schemas.sql: This file includes the code for creating the table schemata in PostgreSQL. 
- data_analysis.sql: This file contains the relevant SQL queries. 

The Resources folder contains the relevant CSV data files. 

The working_docs_archive file contains archived working documents; these are included simply for reference and are not part of the Challenge submission.
